## Setting up the repository

Create a directory anywhere on your computer and enter it. The name/location
does not matter.

`mkdir <dir-name> && cd <dir-name>`

Then init a new git repository. You need to have git installed on your computer.

`git init`

Now link your folder to this repository:

`git remote add https://github.com/AlexanderSkafte/etsa01-group-33.git`

Download all the stuff in the repository:

`git pull origin master`

Now you should have all the files in your directory.
